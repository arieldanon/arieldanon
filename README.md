### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ari!
------------------
Here, you'll find my GitHub where I will be pushing my personal, and school projects to better my knowledge in programming, and hopefully meet more people that are more experienced!
#### About me
----
I'm a first-year Computer Science student (as of '23-'24) currently attending Augustana University. I frequently enjoy coding in Python, and Java. I have no internship experience yet but I strive to be the best in anything I do and this will be one of those things. I'm passionate about problem-solving and always eager to learn more in tech, competitive programming, art, and competitive fps game design.

- Skills: PYTHON / JAVA / C++
#### Goals:
---
- Land my first internship
- Make a full fledged Minecraft mod in Java
- Become more well rounded in C++
